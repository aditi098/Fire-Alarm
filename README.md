# Fire-Alarm
Designed a fire alarm using 8086up as a part of my course Microprocessors and Interfacing

We made complete design for a fire alarm system along with a running code in
assembly language using 8086 microprocessor, 8253-A Programmable Interval Timer,
8255-A Programmable Peripheral Interface, 2732 and 6116 memory and 74LS373,
74LS245, 74LS244 buffers.

The file project.asm has the assembly language code required to run the design(project.dsn). Use proteus to run project.dsn
alongwith project.asm to test the fire alarm.
